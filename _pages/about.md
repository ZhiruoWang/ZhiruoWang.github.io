Nice to Meet You!

This is Zhiruo Wang's home on the web.

I am now a Research Assistant (through the Star Bridge Program) at Microsoft Research, Asia. My current research interest includes, but is not limited to, self-supervised training on tabular data, structure-aware question answering, and the design of model architectures (e.g. Transformers). 
I received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Beijing Normal University. During my college years, I diversely explored multiple fields, from finance, genetic engineering, neuroscience, to natural language processing.
