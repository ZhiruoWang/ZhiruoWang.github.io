Nice to Meet You!

This is Zhiruo Wang's home on the web.

I am now a Research Assistant (through the Star Bridge Program) at Microsoft Research, Asia. My current research interest includes, but is not limited to, self-supervised training on tabular data, structure-aware question answering, and the design of model architectures (e.g. Transformers). 

I have received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Beijing Normal University. 
Next, I will continue to persue a graduate degree at the School of Computer Science (Language Technology Institute) of Carnegie Mellon University.
Despite my current interest on Machine Learning techniques, my diverse explorations span from finance, genetic engineering, neuroscience, to many more.
